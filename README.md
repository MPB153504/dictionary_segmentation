## Interactive Dictionary Segmentation Method

Segmentation method based to some extent on the article [Dictionary Based Image Segmentation](http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/dictionary-based-image-segmentation(3b08c76e-7c7a-4bf9-80e6-c4146513a7f6).html) by Anders Bjorholm Dahl & Vedrana Andersen Dahl. The method is ideal for microscopic images with repeated patterns. The information two sources of information is combined; structure in the image and user provided labels. Image patches of the image are captured and clustered to create a dictionary with the main features of the image. User labels are then propagated from image grid to the dictionary and back to the image gridâ€¨.

A graphical user interface makes the method interactive such that the user can make the segmentation better with feedback.

## How to run
1. You can apply the method by itself (see example.py). Note that the method was implemented for the GUI so some parts might seem unlogical. 

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from dictionary_segmentation import dict_seg
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Load and preprocess the image
dsm = dict_seg.dictionarySegmentationModel()
dsm.load_image('example_images/dummy.png')
dsm.preprocess()

# The number of distinct colors in label image will result in the 
# number of classes
label_im = np.asarray(Image.open('example_images/dummy_label.png'))

# label image is read as RGBA we only use RGB for labelling
dsm.prepare_labels(label_im[:, :, 0:3])

# Propagate labels to dictionary grid and back to image grid
dsm.iterate_dictionary()

seg_im = dsm.segmentation_image
prob_im = dsm.probability_image

plt.imshow(seg_im)
plt.show()
```

2. You can use the GUI by running the my_gui.py (PyQt 5.11.3 is required). 

*I recommended creating a Python environment with the exact versions as below*

### Requirements 
Python 3.5.2

PyQt5==5.11.3

PyQt5-sip==4.19.13

numpy==1.13.3

qimage2ndarray==1.7

scipy==1.0.0

scikit-learn==0.19.1

Pillow==4.3.0
